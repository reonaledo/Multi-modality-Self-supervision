As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities in both lung apices, notably on the right, have slightly increased in extent and severity. The opacity at the lung bases, left more than right, are constant in appearance. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged mild blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small left pleural effusion. The right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
