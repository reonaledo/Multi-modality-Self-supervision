In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are slightly lower with associated crowding of bronchovascular structures. Even allowing for this factor, there appears to be slight worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion. Worsening linearly oriented right basilar opacity probably reflects atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is possible in appropriate clinical setting. Subsegmental atelectasis at the left base has improved in the interval and a small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated.
