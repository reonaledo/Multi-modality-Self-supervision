A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Small left and moderate layering right pleural effusions have increased in size since the preceding day's exam. The right middle lobe pnemonia seen on recent CT is not clearly differentiated, but the right heart border is obscured. Left basilar atelectasis is stable. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Hila remain indistinct. A left-sided PICC line tip remains in the upper SVC.
