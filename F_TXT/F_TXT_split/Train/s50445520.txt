The endotracheal tube has its tip 11 cm above the carina. Advancement by approximately 5-6 cm is recommended to place the tip at the thoracic inlet. House staff are aware as subsequent imaging confirms satisfactory positioning. There has been interval appearance of layering left effusion with retrocardiac consolidation suggestive of collapse of the left lower lobe. A superimposed infectious process in the left lower lung cannot be excluded. In addition, there is opacification at the right lung base suggestive of volume loss with at least partial collapse of the right lower and middle lobe. A superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
